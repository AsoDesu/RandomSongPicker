 # What does it do?
Chooses a random song from [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) and downloads it!

You can access it at [https://random-song-picker.glitch.me](https://random-song-picker.glitch.me)

# Contributing

Download the source files.... run an HTML server.... fix code.... done :)

Or if you dont want to download files, you can remix on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/?utm_content=project_random-song-picker&utm_source=remix_this&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=glitchButton#!/remix/random-song-picker)

# Please note

I know this is kind of useless because there is a mod that does the same thing.... in game... but i did this project to help teach myself about Front-End Development and using REST API's
